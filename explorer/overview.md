# Mobility Explorer

Mobility Explorer helps you understand transportation networks around the world. Search for a place or browse the map, and use the buttons to view transit routes, stops, and operators.

Use Mobility Explorer to query and visualize transit data from [Transitland](https://transit.land), a community-edited, open transit data aggregation project that Mapzen sponsors, and to analyze access using other Mapzen Mobility services, including [Mapzen Isochrone](/documentation/isochrones/).
